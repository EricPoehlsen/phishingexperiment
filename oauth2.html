        <h1>Seriously ?!</h1>
        <p><b><?php print $num; ?> login attempts have been recorded ... </b></p> 
        <p>People! What is wrong with you?! In case you actually entered your real Google or Facebook login credentials they were transmitted to this server! This is a classic phishing page and it was put together in just a few minutes!</p>
        <p><b>This system did not store, use or transmit the data entered into the login form.</b> But if you fell for it please reconsider the way you are using the internet!</p>

        <h3>Some Thoughts!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the address bar - is that really the page you want to access?</li>
            <li>Did you receive a link per e-mail? Do not follow it. Go directly to the page by entering the URL into the browser address bar!</li>
            <li>An HTTPS connection (green lock) only says that the connection between your computer and the server is encrypted - it says nothing about what happens to the data transmitted ...</li>
        </ul>
